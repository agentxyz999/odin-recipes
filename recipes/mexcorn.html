    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I consider this to be the greatest corn-on-the-cob recipe of all time.</p>
    <p>The way the mild, subtly salted cheese works with an ancho-lime mayonnaise, along with that buttery, smoky corn, is a magnificent combination of flavors.</p> 
    <p>Perfecto!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground ancho chile pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>8 ears corn on the cob, husked</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup freshly grated Cotija cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 lime, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>

        <li>Combine mayonnaise, lime juice, ancho chile powder, and smoked paprika in a bowl; whisk until smooth. Refrigerate until needed.</li>
        
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil corn in the salted water for 5 minutes. Drain the corn.</li>

        <li>Place ears of corn on hot grill and cook until the kernels begin to brown and caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the corn and continue to cook, turning ears after 1 to 2 minutes, until they are browned with slightly charred, caramelized spots.</li>
        <li>Generously brush corn with melted butter and ancho-lime mayonnaise until kernels are coated. Sprinkle ears with Cotija cheese and salt. Garnish with slices of lime.</li>
    </ol>
